ORIZON — Brand Visual & Color Guidelines (v1.0)

A hybrid enterprise + cinematic brand system inspired by Gargantua (Interstellar).

1. Brand Essence

Orizon represents the threshold between the known and the unknown — a gateway that unifies intelligence across multiple AI/LLM systems.

The identity is anchored in:

The Gargantua-inspired black hole logomark

Light bending around a singularity

Energy, convergence, and gravitational distortion

A clean, modern enterprise wordmark: RIZON (without an O at the beginning)

2. Core Logo Architecture
2.1 Primary Logo (Blue Gargantua)

Logomark: Blue energy ring with gravitational distortion and black core

Wordmark: RIZON in modern geometric sans-serif

Spacing: Logomark flush to “R”

No additional “O” — the logomark is the O.

Approved Variants:

Dark background

Light background

Transparent PNG

High resolution (4K)

2.2 Secondary Logo (Orange Accretion Disk)

3. Logo Usage Rules

3.3 Do NOT:

Do not add a letter “O” in front of RIZON

Do not stretch, rotate, or distort the logomark

Do not recolor the logomark outside approved palette

Do not place logo on complex or high-noise backgrounds

Do not apply drop shadows
